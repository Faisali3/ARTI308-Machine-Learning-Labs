Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Chocolate Sales Dataset
Course: ARTI308 - Machine Learning
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to a dataset containing chocolate sales records. In Machine Learning, understanding the data is a critical first step (representing 70-80% of the project time). This analysis aims to:
- Clean and format raw data (handling dates and currency symbols).
- Identify missing values and duplicates to ensure data quality.
- Visualize sales distribution and revenue patterns across different products.
- Analyze the correlation between shipping volume and total revenue.
- Track monthly trends to provide actionable business insights.

2. Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas (Data manipulation)
- NumPy (Numerical operations)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)

3. Key Findings:
- Successfully cleaned the 'Amount' column by removing currency symbols and converting to numeric types.
- Identified "Smooth Sliky Salty" as the top-performing product in terms of revenue.
- Confirmed a positive correlation between boxes shipped and revenue through a correlation matrix.
- Visualized monthly revenue trends which show the growth patterns over the recorded period.
